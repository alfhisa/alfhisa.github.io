You are given **two arrays of sorted numbers**.  
Your task is to check whether **any number appears in both arrays or not**.

---

## Input Format

- The first line contains two integers **N1** and **N2**, representing the length of array **X1** and **X2** respectively.
- The second line contains **N1** integers of array **X1**.
- The third line contains **N2** integers of array **X2**.

---

## Output Format

- Output **`UNIQUE`** if **no number appears in both arrays**.
- Output **`NOT UNIQUE`** if **at least one number appears in both arrays**.

---

<!-- ## Constraints

- \( 1 \leq N1, N2 \leq 100000 \)
- \( 1 \leq X1_i, X2_i \leq 10000000 \)

## Sample Input

```
3 4
1 3 4
4 5 7 8
```

---

## Sample Output

```
NOT UNIQUE
```

---

## Notes

- Both arrays are already **sorted**.
- Efficient solutions are recommended due to large input sizes.
