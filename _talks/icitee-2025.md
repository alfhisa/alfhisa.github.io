I had the opportunity to attend and present my research paper, “Oil Palm Condition Monitoring via UAV Imagery Using YOLOv11 Enhanced for Class Imbalance,” at the 17th International Conference on Information Technology and Electrical Engineering (ICITEE 2025), held in Bangkok, Thailand, on October 20, 2025.

This conference provided a valuable platform to share my research on UAV-based oil palm monitoring and to discuss recent advances in deep learning for precision agriculture with researchers. Participating in ICITEE 2025 also offered insightful discussions, constructive feedback, and opportunities for academic networking that will contribute to the further development of this research.
