I had the opportunity to present my research paper, “Evaluating the Adversarial Vulnerability of YOLOv11 for Indonesian Sign Language (BISINDO) Recognition,” at the 8th International Conference on Informatics and Computational Sciences (ICICoS 2025), held on October 29, 2025, in Semarang, Thailand.

This conference served as an important platform to disseminate my research on the robustness and security aspects of deep learning models for sign language recognition, particularly in the context of adversarial attacks on YOLOv11. Participating in ICICoS 2025 enabled valuable discussions with fellow researchers, constructive feedback from experts in computer vision and AI security, and meaningful academic networking that will support the continued development and extension of this research.
